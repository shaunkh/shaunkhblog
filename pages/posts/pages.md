# [Tetranode on Bankless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHlt9lrL3gk)

Gaming as crypto training

- See it as an RTS game like starcraft
  - There’s a fog of war, you go out and scout to get as much info
  - So you can get situated the best you can in the situation
- Taught Tetra about resource management and taught him to act with limited information
- Starcraft lends a better background to crypto than poker because you have to take into account so much information and make split second decisions.
- Example: 4 on 4, one guy talks shit on other side, 4 of us conspires to fuck one guy over.
  - Teamwork and lots of market making/psychology involved

Who is Tetranode?

- Crypto is a hobby for him
- Was a gamer and was looking for graphics cards
- Found bitcoin because he found a forum by searching for graphics cards
- Tried to send 100$ to Mt. Gox. but process was difficult (regret xd)
- In 2013 started DCA over three years into BTC after mt. gox crash

Never felt like a whale till he started moving markets

- Held first 4 years of crypto
- Built discipline unlike rotatooors today
- Crypto and wealth is just a number but what it gives you is privacy
- Whole point of crypto/money is to do what he wants when he wants. Also to use it to push crypto space

Purpose of wealth

- Not in podcasts but connects to Punk6529’s levels
- Started off at level 1 by just trying to make money to live
- Invested in ventures that didn’t do well
  - Some made profit
- Policy for projects he invests in: is Tetra going to be their biggest customer
- Denominates portfolio in ETH
  - Need ETH to market make
  - Even when crossing bridges, you need ETH
    - “Hardest money on Earth”

Why bullish on ETH?

- Back in the day, got excited by comparing to what BTC offered.

Can’t trust other alt L1s like Solana that make bad engineering tradeoffs

Why decentralization matters?

- i.e. a bunch of nodes shutting down if they get too large
- Censorship resistant

Tetra’s Infinity Gauntlet

- Looks for product market fit
  - Does it incorporate into day to day operations?
  - Will I use this and be their biggest customer?
- Not to worried about tokenomics because he gives inputs
  - i.e. don’t do buybacks
- Dopex is highest conviction play
  - Team just doesn’t stop shipping
  - Addressable market is 11 figs
  - Stablecoin coming out created from $RDPX
- Redacted and OHM
  - Each own 10% of each other’s DAOs
  - Tweaking 3,3 model so anytime it reaches under RFV, they can redeem and do treasury operations so they have limit floor of RFV
  - OHM is backed and there seems to be market efficiency because they have a lot of money (rn 506 mil) to use
  - Fei Protocol and Rari merge
    - Coming out with products that increase capital efficiency
      - ERC4626
        - Allows for depositing yielding asset into FUSE and can borrow money for it
      - Fei coming out with Turbo
        - Can mint FEI off certain pools and get interest free FEI through farming
- RocketPool
  - Only decentralized staking option currently
  - As a node operator you can stake other people’s ethereum
  - There’s RPL and it’s not useless token but you need 10% RPL in staking pool as insurance
- Chainlink is agnostic framework (????) that is used as an oracle
  - Can go anywhere but chooses to be on Ethereum
- CRV is progressing
  - CRV v2 coming soon, lets people create pools like Uniswap
  - Tokenomics is best that Tetra has come across.
  - Governance isn’t too useful but profit sharing gives some intrinsic value

Farmers have the best alpha?

- Farmers are operators and know exactly when treasury bleeds
- pleyuh, degenspartan

How to play and move markets?

- Tetra can move markets
- Force bottoms, move markets with tweets
- Not a market maker
  - There are people 30x his NW that are market makers like 3AC, Alameda and maybe Jump
- Lots of info asymmetry
  - Find a way to take advantage of it
- How do you have the conviction to place your money there after finding these?
  - “You know it but others do not”
  - No consequences till several months down the road
  - Use your own judgement

Advice to be a whale

- First principles approach
  - Learn building blocks (basic cryptography) and its implications (economics)
- Skin in the game
  - Operate, operate, operate
  - Don’t do it blindly but through the first principles backing
