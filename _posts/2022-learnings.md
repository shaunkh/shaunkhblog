# Some things I learned in 2022

This was the first year I actually finished a journal because I developed a daily journaling habit since March. I didn’t get through a full year of daily journaling but it’s a massive improvement from last year where I only journaled during the summer. There were plenty of ups and downs, probably way more downs and I was able to document as much as I could and I’m glad that I did. When I was reviewing them **I learned a lot more about myself, specifically more about how I can continue to build great habits, improve my skills and constantly direct myself to where I want to go.**

**These are the important bits that stood out to me.**

**I was able to build a habit of journaling and meditating every day** by starting by writing one to two sentences and meditating twelve minutes a day. Another tool I used was a habit tracker on my phone. At one point it went up to 130 days straight for both and one of the reasons I stuck with it was because it hurt more to lose that streak. I couldn’t lie to myself if I missed a day.

I spent a large amount of time on reading various books. I read plenty of fiction and self help books. Some of them include Musashi, Harry Potter, and the Lean Startup. I don’t count biographies as non fiction because they are told through an authors’ lens. Highlighting on my kindle and using Readwise helped me remember more than I ever expected from each of the books.

Didn’t spend as much time learning Spanish as I’d hoped. I moved to Miami thinking I would spend more time learning Spanish but I didn’t put in enough effort. An app like Duolingo isn’t enough for me to stick to it so to keep myself accountable I will be getting a teacher for the new year.

Quit vaping which was huge. I realized with the help of a book that I forgot the name of that physical cravings only last about a month. Now I have no issues staying off getting a nicotine buzz. I still use my friends’ ones sometimes but never buying my own again.

I got two tattoos in the span of two weeks! I filled up my forearm with Naruto tattoos that I was initially scared for but mostly because I had to hide them from my family initially. Ripped the band aid off because my mom ended up telling everyone.

**I can actually be funny if I try, who thought?** I’ve written almost a joke a day and some made me laugh out loud.

**Go spend more time travelling and doing activities you can only do while you’re young (i.e. snowboarding).**

**Be more polarizing.** Not everyone’s going to like you and not everyone has to. Don’t compromise on your beliefs. Have your strong opinions but they should be weakly held if they can be invalidated. This is a big part of charisma and realizing you don’t need to care what someone else thinks of you because that’s their job not yours.

If you’re missing out on something fun because you want to sleep, realize that you have time to sleep later. You’re not always going to get the best sleep so make sure the times that you don’t, it’s worth it. It’s always worth it if it’s with good friends.

**Approach and talk to more people.** This will not only help you with dating which you are so horrible at right now but creating more relationships down the line.

Last thing I'll leave you with which helped me do the hard work when I needed to. Mostly to ignore my constant need to
check my phone and to stop watching YouTube to pass time.
**One day you’ll look at yourself and realize you haven’t achieved what you wanted because you spent all your time feeding your dopamine addictions.**
